                                        The main concept for this game was originally to be a starship shooter. Before commiting and implementing 
                                        this style of game however, we decided to conduct a small, one day survey at Stony Brook University 
                                        to determine the most desirable genre of game for a 2D game out of 3 genres (platformers, starship, top-down). 
                                        The winner was the platformer genre which lead to the overhauling of the  original concept idea in order to 
                                        create a game more entertaining and player-friendly in terms of difficulty for newer players. The idea
                                        was to use 3 different modes each set with different strengths and weaknesses to overcome different sets of 
                                        obstacles in order to progress through the level. The final result was the following concept for Enyos Escape:

                                        For this project there were to be mainly 4 types of roles, that of the artist, sound engineer, level designer and programmer. 
                                        With our team already having a background in computer science however, we all decided to program to gain experience with 
                                        Typescript. One member focused on the UI and 'cheatcodes' of the game, while the other member and I focused on player 
                                        mobility and player-level interaction. I alone later implemented a few game features to address some

                                        video covers. This combined with my admiration of the nastalgic 8-bit style including 8-bit music naturally

                                        as well as the sound effects used. My final work with this role was creating the trailer theme for our submission 
                                        upon the decision on becoming a finalist in the SBU Annual Game Programming Competition.

                                        This role was something that was insisted I take after I designed an initial concept for the character Enyo and 
                                        the art for the set of space levels. Graphic design and pixel art is something I enjoy doing in my spare time which proved 
                                        to be a great asset for this project. In this role I designed the art for the original character Enyo, the logo, the set of levels 
                                        as well as all enemies found in the game. My final work with this role was designing the artwork for the final unlockable 
                                        mode of Enyo the 'Zen' mode which uses the combined attributes of all modes in one.

                                        This role is one that emerges once a group is confirmed on becoming a finalist in the Annual Stony Brook Game Programming 
                                        Competition. Teams are given 5-7 days to create and submit a game trailer to represent their game as finalists. During this time 
                                        I was the only member available, however, with my prior experience with video editing, I was able to create the music, film gameplay
                                        and edit the game trailer within 2 days. The final result can be viewed again

                                    As a group, I contributed to working on the core gameplay of the game, designing the space set of levels and

                                    The order in which I mention the topics below are the order in which I worked on them with the exception of 'Game Lore' 
                                    which was discussed first but for the purpose of this section, will be discussed last. In the link table above, 
                                    'Game Trailer' is listed first as I wanted to highlight the trailer first in it's own mini-section before delving further 
                                    into the game.

                                            Initially my role with working on the artwork for Enyo's Escape began with designing a demo for what the game logo 
                                            could look like. Rapidly, I had became engrossed with the art the 2D pixel style is able to create and I took on the role 
                                            of the concept artist after creating the game logo.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            I desired to gradually expand on my ambition for the artwork as the levels go up in order to work on all of the modes and 
                                            enemies and allocate more time to working on the sound of the game, level design and programming of the game. For this 
                                            reason, the tilesheets for the levels get much larger every level theme.

                                            Piskel was the main technology used for designing the pixel art for Enyo's Escape. Before this project, I had no prior 
                                            experience with this technology however, it was very user-friendly leading to the learning curve being fairly quick. 
                                            the fuctionality, I got the grasp of it. For the level designs, each member focused on a specific set of levels after 
                                            Once a set of animations are done, a showcase of the animation is displayed before the user chooses to download the gif
                                            of the animation. Once this gif is exported, it can then be loaded in another piskel file to finalize a tilesheet.

                                            As spoken about previously in the 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-overview-concept-origin"><em class="font-sbu-red">concept origin</em></a> 
                                            subsection, Enyo's Escape was originally planned to be a starship shooting game. For this reason the main logo features 
                                            a starship I created that was to serve as Enyo's main vessel and the starship the player were to use. After reconsidering
                                            and switching the game type from a starship shooter to a 2d-platformer, the game lore was changed to Enyo having crash 
                                            landed on Earth, needing to find his ship and escape back to his home planet.

                                        <p>
                                            The game logo displayed this exact lore. Specifically, it depicts Enyo having successfully located his ship on earth and 
                                            in the process of landing on his home planet shown by the purple planet, Midas 47.

                                            Before I finalized the design of the main character Enyo, I had designed Enyo to be more 'alien-like'. Enyo's head 
                                            was designed to be larger, his arms replaced with wing-like apendages and the main form of travel was through 
                                            levitation. Below is the evolution of Enyo's design while in his '<em>idle</em>' animation but more importantly in the 
                                            'default' mode i.e., the <em>mode active upon entering a level</em>.

                                            original concepts of Enyo, I changed his color scheme to light blue instead of green. Previously, the green color 
                                            was to serve as the color for the 'default' mode meaning, a form without any power, the other 3 modes were to have 
                                            different color schemes. From the original concepts to the new concept, the default mode was removed and the user 
                                            was to enter the game in 'jump' mode which has the color scheme of light blue and was set as the new 'default' mode.

                                                From the modified original concept to the new concept, Enyo's default mode is now 'jump'.

                                                From the new concept to the final concept, Enyo's idle animation is changed to be less robot-like.

                                                In the final concept, Enyo's particles are now bigger to better showcase descending and ascending.

                                            I have always been fascinated with 'animated skins' in video games, such as clothing that emits and dims out light or 
                                            artwork that moves. For this reason I decided to include particles in Enyo's design to display his power or rather, the 
                                            current mode he is in currently.

                                            The concept for Enyo's modes elaborate from the final concept displayed above, changing the primary color of the body, 
                                            the color of the particles that Enyo emits and the particle movement that emphasize which power Enyo is currently using.

                                            damage and death. Notably, tween animations were used in Enyo's Escape as well for inverting Enyo's movement when 
                                            going leftward.

                                            The 'snake' enemy serves as our first type of enemy. They are encountered in the first two levels of the game, 
                                            specifically in the desert levels. To fit the desert theme, I contemplated between designing a scorpion or a snake but 
                                            decided to create snakes as the first enemy because of the color scheme bringing more life into the game. The snake has  
                                            the common green skin with a beige belly and red tounge that protracts and can be seen slithering in the desert.

                                            The 'alien' enemy serves as our third and final type of enemy. They are encountered in the last two levels of the game, 
                                            specifically in the space levels. To fit the space theme, I contemplated between designing an alien or simple meteors 
                                            but decided to create aliens as the enemy as they could bring more platforming to the game through floating around if 
                                            created using 'spaceships'. The alien is green and is inside a spaceship that lights up and hovers around, gradually 
                                            moving in any one-way direction. These enemies bounce off of walls and ceilings.

                                            The concept for the first two levels were to be centered around the 'desert' theme. This desert has a sky that 
                                            is a dull blue filled with off white clouds, the pavement is a dull brown soil with a bit of sand and has 
                                            cactus and branches scattered across. Some additional artwork I added was the use of signs in order to help 
                                            the player understand which mode they should be using to traverse the level at the point the sign is encountered.

                                            of the level tilesets. I desired to gradually expand on my ambition for the artwork as the levels go up in order 
                                            to work on all of the modes and enemies and allocate more time to working on the sound of the game, level design 
                                            and programming of the game.

                                            The concept for the middle two levels were to be centered around the 'lab' theme. This lab has a dull green 
                                            background that is filled with pipes of two different colors (dark gray and light green) to give more contrast 
                                            to the level, some ladders and some windows. The pavement is green tiles with the bottom underneath these tiles, 
                                            set to be dark tiles of stripes and dots for added contrast.

                                            It is filled with desks that can contain testubes, beakers, monitors or a chasis, and can be mixed and matched 
                                            with desks that optionally contain one, two or no chairs. Lying on the ground are alien eggs being incubated 
                                            for testing and the level contains switch doors with switches. The green switch can be pressed by any mode, 
                                            but the purple one can only be pressed with the 'heavy' mode. Finally, the end of level 4 contains Enyo's 
                                            spaceship that is needed in order to travel back to the stars.

                                            as I wanted to really nail the concept of a mysterious lab where scientists pose a threat to aliens, making 
                                            Enyo's situation feel more hopeless.

                                            The concept for the last two levels were to be centered around the 'space' or 'galaxy' theme that was popular in the 2d-era
                                            when Galactica was king. I designed this tileset to be modular in mixing and matching sets of pavements that in this level 
                                            are detailed comet ground, with craters beneath them, stars that consists of 3 main colors (light blue, dark orange, and 
                                            dark yellow), 3 large planets consisting of 4 individual 8x8 tiles creating a tile of 16 x 16 pixels each (red, green and 
                                            royal blue with a ring), 2 smaller planets (orange and purple), and 1 individial dull blue medium planet with a ring of 
                                            16 x 8 pixels. In the background of each space level there is a lining of a large comet to give the depiction of how large
                                            space is in contrast to Enyo through the size of a comet.

                                            My favorite addition to these levels are the purple supernovas that I created using 2 sets of 4 individual 8 x 8 tiles, 
                                            stacked one after another diagonally to give the appearance of an infinitely large supernova across the stars. Another favorite of 
                                            mine was the inclusion of the warp tiles that are also 4 sets of 8 x 8 tiles, the blue one is found at the end of the game
                                            while the white one is used to teleport to the 
                                            secret level 
                                            and are found in the secret level as a means of transportation.

                                        <p>
                                            To conclude, the space levels contain new type of tiles, the insta-kill lava tiles and teleport tiles. Other tiles with 
                                            the same functionality of crumble are found as well but have new designs to fit the theme of space.

                                            Below is the tilesheet for the space level I created using Piskel. It is the <em>largest</em> of the tilesets and the theme 
                                            that I looked forward to designing the most. As I have always been fascinated with the universe as a whole, I had a deep 
                                            desire to create a design that would personify the simple beauty of the stars through the nastalgic 2d pixel style. This 
                                            larger tileset was created with that desire.

                                            The UI artwork were the last things I worked on regarding artwork for Enyo's Escape after the character and level 
                                            tilesheets were finalized. For the UI, there are two main types of icons that are used, one to display the health 
                                            currently remaining on Enyo that range from the colors green, yellow, orange and red, while the other icon displays 
                                            the current mode Enyo is in. Before the game programming competition commenced, I included an additional mode icon for the 
                                            'Zen' mode. It takes inspiration from the previous icons, using the main color of each mode and their main 
                                            indicator (i.e., a purple dumbell for 'heavy'). Below are all UI Icons seen in the game.

                                            Initially my role with working on the music and sound for Enyo's Escape began with designing a theme for the space 
                                            level. After doing so I came to the realization that I enjoyed the act of composing sounds to create the music 
                                            for a specific theme, and so I insisted I work on the sound for Enyo's Escape.

                                            Chiptone was used for creating every individual .wav file in Enyo's Escape with the exception of the main theme 
                                            Some of these .wav files were edited in Chiptone and finalized then used in the game as-is. Chiptone uses a keyboard 
                                            for manipulating the key note the sound clip uses and knobs on the bottom for additional effects if desired. For the 
                                            level music of the desert theme, lab theme and space theme another technology needed to be used.

                                            Audacity was used to take individual .wav sound files to compose them into level music for all three game themes 
                                            of desert, lab and space. Specifically, this software allowed me to normalize sound as I added and merged sound 
                                            files together as well as time sound files accurately when making melodies.

                                            Online Sequencer was used soley to create a piano theme as the main theme for Enyo's Escape. Pieces composed on the 
                                            software can use a range of instruments as well as take on a variety of effects. I decided to use the piano specifically 
                                            for the purpose of creating a music box melody in the key of C minor as this key is known for being melancholic and 
                                            is often associated with sadness.

                                            Originally, there was no plan to create a main theme for the game but that was changed when Enyo's Escape made it as a

                                            This theme is the first and only audio that was not created using Chiptone, but rather an online application known as 
                                            Online Sequencer. I decided to go with a simple piano using the musicbox effect to convey the bittersweet feeling 
                                            a journey such as what the main character Enyo faces must feel like. For this reason, I used the C minor scale as it 
                                            is known to envoke sadness.

                                            As the first stage the player encounters upon entering the game is centered around the 'desert' theme, I decided 
                                            to capitalize on the empty and arguably lonely nature of the desert to create another melancholic theme using the 
                                            C minor scale. This theme features a loud beat (beginning at 0:03) to convey to the player that this journey has begun 
                                            and a main melody (also beginning at 0:03) that uses the C minor scale. 
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The theme also uses sound effects to enhance the theme such as a distorted 'hollowing out' sound that creates a 
                                            sense of anxiety from 0:00 - 0:03. Another sound effect used is the hiss of a snake at 0:10 and 0:25 to remind the 
                                            player that there is no life in this desert beside snakes and Enyo himself.

                                        <!-- Sound Lab Theme: Concept Explanation -->

                                        <h5 class="project-subsection-subtopic-header">Concept Explanation</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            For the 'lab' theme, I decided to create a more energetic beat that creates a sense of urgency and anxiety. 
                                            I did so to establish the context that is Enyo's current situation. Enyo has found a scientific base that 
                                            conducts experimentation on alien life forms (exactly what Enyo is on Earth) and Enyo must traverse the lab to 
                                            find his ship. The theme uses a constant fast pased beat (beginning at 0:06) that uses notes that sound like 
                                            an alarm from 0:01 - 0:06 that conveys the sense of urgency and a main riff (beginning at 0:11) that conveys the 
                                            sense of anxiety like time is limited. 
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The theme also uses sound effects to enhance the theme such as at 0:00 that sounds like Enyo has 'fallen' deep 
                                            into an underground base, 0:06 and 0:28 that sound like it could be unknown technology or life forms to Enyo 
                                            and 0:16 that sounds like the cries of some life form being experimented on.
                                        </p>

                                        <!-- Sound Lab Theme: Sample -->

                                            Below is a sample of what the lab theme sounds like. This theme plays during the middle two stages of the game.
                                            It was created using <em>Chiptone</em> for generating and manipulating sound (waveform audio files or <em>.wav</em> 
                                            files) and <em>Audacity</em> for taking said files and creating compositions.

                                        <!-- Sound Space Theme: Concept Explanation -->

                                        <h5 class="project-subsection-subtopic-header">Concept Explanation</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            For the 'space' theme as with the 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-artwork-space-level-art"><em class="font-sbu-red">level artwork</em></a> 
                                            for this level, I decided to give more time to this theme to correctly capture the feel for this level 
                                            being the vacuum of space. To achieve this I decided to use 'space-like' or distorted sounds and beats as well  
                                            as overlaying the main riff with another instance of the main riff to get a strange sounding composition.
                                            Unlike the previous two levels themes, the main riff begins at 0:00 in this composition and persists throughout.
                                            The base is a simple 1-2 beat with distortion. Using this, I sought to convey the feeling of the unkown of the 
                                            vastness that is space in contrast to our perspective (the player).
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The theme also uses sound effects to enhance the theme such as the beat drop at 0:04 that sounds as if sound is 
                                            being sucked into the vacuum of space, into an underground base, 0:16 and 0:46 that sound like it could be an 
                                            alien spaceships distancing themselves and 0:38 that is to be an unkown sound to convey the mystery of space.
                                        </p>

                                            In this subsection I briefly go over some details of the levels that I designed, specifically the motive behind the 
                                            layout. My main focus was on the space set of level with the 'Secret Level' being created after the initial set of 6 
                                            levels. Below are the levels I created:

                                            Tiled was the main technology used for designing the levels for Enyo's Escape. As I had no prior experience with this 
                                            technology, the learning curve for this software was challenging for me at first but after creating a beta level to test 
                                            the fuctionality, I got the grasp of it. For the level designs, each member focused on a specific set of levels after 
                                            their respective 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-artwork-introduction"><em class="font-sbu-red">artwork</em></a> 
                                            had been completed. For myself, I wanted to challenge myself with designing the levels that would 
                                            challenge the player the most being levels 5 and 6 and later on the 'Secret Level'.

                                            The motive behind the layout for level 5 is to provide a challenge with required quick transitions between 'jump' mode 
                                            and 'speed' mode to traverse the level. These set of space levels is where the game begins to test the player's 
                                            reaction time with the introduction of the 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-artwork-enemy-concept-art-and-animations"><em class="font-sbu-red">floating alien enemy</em></a> 
                                            as obstacles in this level. Additionally, well-timed jumps are demanded from the player in order to bridge the gap between 
                                            large platforms on this level. Failure to do so would lead the player to fall into the lava pit which results in an 
                                            instant game over.

                                            The motive behind this layout is similar to that of level 5 emphasizing the quick transition between modes however this 
                                            level makes need of the 'heavy' mode in between modes to attack the large number of alien enemies found in this level. 
                                            Towards the end of the level there are 2 ways one can traverse, the secret path underneath the largest meteor platform 
                                            avoids the entire meteor all together and allows for achieving the 'S' rank while the top is a little less forgiving but 
                                            requires perfectly timed jumps in 'jump' mode as well as well-placed attacks to traverse this meteor vertically.

                                            As level 6 is a space level, the 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-game-features-level-interactions"><em class="font-sbu-red">teleport tiles</em></a>

                                            are prevalent. I designed this level to be the 'hardest' in the game with the end of the level being the most difficult obstacle to overcome 
                                            from levels 1 to 6. To the right we can see a brief showcase of the shortcuts available in the level that are needed to achieve an 'S' rank 
                                            on this stage. Try to achieve this! Though fair warning, it's quite difficult.

                                            One final thing worth pointing out is the level skip I implemented for this level. It was designed to skip the entirety of the level as a 
                                            safe measure in case the level proves too challenging to complete.

                                             In order to skip this level, the player must walk off the edge of the starting platform after jumping past the lava

                                             be invoked upon touching it, warping the player at the end of the level. Switch to 'speed' mode to touch the whiteholes 
                                             to beat the game.

                                            I designed this final 'Secret Level' to be a reward after completing the game and unlocking a fun hidden mode the 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-game-features-secret-mode-unlock"><em class="font-sbu-red">'Zen' mode.</em></a> 
                                            This level's design was made with the idea to keep the player moving as the floors are collapsible and filled with lava 
                                            pits and bottomless holes.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The level contains every form of level interaction from levels 1 to 6 as obstacles to overcome in the many 'meteor rooms' 
                                            that this level contains. After traversing the first meteor rooms, the player must overcome a 'free fall' section that 
                                            has no meteors in sight. The space level's artwork is best seen in this area.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            As this 'Secret Level' is a space level, the 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-game-features-level-interactions"><em class="font-sbu-red">teleport tiles</em></a> 
                                            and 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-game-features-level-interactions"><em class="font-sbu-red">lava tiles</em></a> 
                                            are prevalent however, so are every other form of tile including the collapsible tile and switch tile. Prior to designing 
                                            this level, I made updates to the space tilesheet a week before the SBU Game Programming Competition in order to differentiate 
                                            the secret level from levels 5 and 6. This level features new aesthetic tiles from the 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-artwork-space-level-art"><em class="font-sbu-red">space level tilesheet.</em></a> 
                                            Again, this level can only be traversed with 'Zen' mode as all other modes abilities alone are not enough. Designed as the true 
                                            hardest level in the game, can you 'S'rank it?

                                        <p>
                                            With little time left before presenting the game as a Finalist at the Annual SBU Game Programming Competition and as 
                                            the sole member available to present, I made the decision to address some of the 
                                            <a class="quick-link" href="#section-enyos-escape-play-testing"><em class="font-sbu-red">feedback</em></a> 
                                            given to us. To summarize, play testers felt the game was fun and had potential but lacking in the reward factor. 
                                            The ranking system, secret mode unlock and secret level unlock were implemented shortly and swiftly after this.

                                            For the purpose of this game feature, I made cycling between modes be executable both in a clockwise 
                                            (speed, attack, jump) and counter-clockwise fashion (attack, speed, jump). This change allowed changing 
                                            between 2 modes simultaneously (i.e., speed -> jump -> speed) to be performed which greatly increased 
                                            gameplay speed. Another notable addition to increase gameplay speed was to introduce the mouse click as an 
                                            option for attacking. This allowed for the 'jump' mode to be used in a safer way to defeat enemies or blitzing 
                                            through levels using the 'speed' mode.

                                            A frequent reward from single player games is to introduce certain game-changing power-ups after completing the game to 
                                            further incentivize gameplay through this replayability factor. Normally these power-ups would render previous levels 
                                            obsolete in terms of offering a challenging experience. For Enyo's Escape, this makes obtaining 'S' ranks easier however 
                                            the true challenge comes with the secret level that is only accessible through a specific area in the game in a certain 
                                            level while using this secret mode.

                                            The secret 'Zen' mode holds the attributes of all modes in one. It jumps as high as 'jump' mode, has the speed and 
                                            velocity of 'speed' mode and is a form that can attack on its own like 'attack' mode can. This mode is unlocked 
                                            once beating level 6 of the game and can be activated by selecting the 'Z' key on the keyboard.

                                            last used prior to the initial activation of this mode.

                                            Another frequent reward given after game completion in single player games is to introduce more challenging levels or 
                                            introduce a new difficulty level. For Enyo's Escape, I decided to increase the replayability factor by implementing the 
                                            former that is to introduce a new challenging level for the player to complete after compelting the standard set of 6
                                            levels. This plays out as follows.
                                        </p>

                                            Upon completing the final level, the player gains the ability to physically access a new area of a specific level with 
                                            the mobility boost provided by using 'Zen' mode. This level is on one of the space levels I designed specifically in 
                                            level 5 
                                            on the left side of the rock platforms. Overlapping the white hole as demonstrated above causes the player to 
                                            warp into the secret level where the use of 'Zen' mode is required to traverse the level safely as all other modes are 
                                            insufficient by themselves.

                                            Each member had a few ideas on the type of reactions certain floor tiles will and should have depending on which level 
                                            the player is currently on. The general idea was to start off with easy tiles strictly for platforming purposes to 
                                            slightly more difficult tiles with time-based platforming with the switch to more challenging teleport tiles and 
                                            insta-kill lava tiles.

                                            The teleport tiles only appear in the space levels. These levels are Level 5, Level 6 and the Secret Level that is only 
                                            accessible through Level 5 after unlocking 'Zen' mode. These tiles simply warp the player to another part of the level 
                                            but offer little to no prior warning about incoming obstacles facing the player after warping.

                                            In this subsection I briefly go over some details of the game trailer I created for the 2024 Stony Brook Game 
                                            Programming Competition. There were a total of 3 technologies that I used in creating the trailer after getting 
                                            an idea of what I wanted the trailer to highlight. The music, video editing and gameplay were handled by me.

                                            The main idea of the trailer was to convey 4 main concepts of the game that would entice people to play while intentionally
                                            muting any gameplay sound in order to highlight the main theme.

                                                The quick use of modes in order to traverse through levels quickly and safely.

                                            I wanted a 'bittersweet' take for the theme, a theme that could convey what a journey in isolation through unknown land 
                                            for a small creature would be like. This was the main reason for ommiting any game sounds for the trailer. A choice to 
                                            help viewers feel the silence and sorrow that could come from such a journey which Enyo must face alone.

                                            was my editor of choice. My experience using this software was primarily from a few AMV's I have worked 
                                            on recreationally. The software allows for easily editing both sound and video.

                                            The main difficulty I faced while editing the trailer was the use of the title slides. DaVinci is notorious for having 
                                            a high learning curve for editing title effects (i.e., timing, slow-motion, lighting, placement). Because of this, 
                                            when editing I used placeholder black screens while I edited the gameplay and executed titles last.

                                            was my screen recorder of choice. My experience using this software was mainly from dabbling with recording music 
                                            covers through my laptop which later was replaced with a professional camera. For this project, I used OBS Studio to record 
                                            myself playing through all desert levels, lab levels and space levels as fast as needed to acquire a high rank (0:35 in 
                                            trailer). As of now and for the foreseeable future, I will continue to use this software if I am needing to stream and record.

                                            straightforward. To use it, one need select the notes on the virtual keyboard you would like to link for the track to play. 
                                            Prior to generating the melody, I composed it on my keyboard before translating it on Online Sequencer.

                                            remained a discussion until I mispronounced 'Kansas' with 'Kenya' and thought of

                                            'Midas' was the original name of the planet I proposed for Enyo's backstory. All members agreed that the name seemed 
                                            a bit lacking before another member proposed it have a number associated with it to give the planet an 'unregistered planet'

                                            This was the final part that I contributed to the game lore. Previous names proposed by all members were 'Enyo's Journey', 
                                            'The Journey of Enyo', 'Enyoception'. After some thought of what the goal of Enyo was in this game, namely to escape Earth 
                                            and journey back to his home planet, I proposed the name 
                                            <em class="font-sbu-red">'Enyo's Escape'</em> which immediately stuck.

                                            Nice game! The music, sound effects, and artwork are very cohesive and the maps are challenging and well designed.

                                            The mechanic of switching between three characters to combat platforming obstacles is pretty unique and cool. The music 
                                            is neat.

                                            I liked the music and the art style. Cycling through the characters is very fun and I like how they all have different 
                                            characteristics.

                                            The movement is fun, good speed and the character switching mechanic is a good idea. Feels like an old school Megaman 
                                            game.

                                            You can't strafe with a or d when it the air (if you jump while not holding a or d), which just feels wrong when playing. 
                                            It is inconsistent with the movement when you do hold a or d when jumping as you are allowed to strafe left or right in 
                                            that case.

                                            Falling through the sand at the bottom of the level does not result in a game over. Instead, the character is able to 
                                            move around and reach the end of the level while under the floor, essentially skipping the whole level.

                                            Has potential but needs to be ironed out a bit, art and pace feels good and definitely has reason to try.

                                        The overall positive feedback was the art and music of the game with mixed reviews on the movement of the game with some 
                                        players expressing concern with the jump mechanics and others content with the speed of the game. Thus for the remaining 
                                        time of the project up until then focus was to be placed on the core gameplay.

                                    <p>
                                        The overall negative feedback was that the game felt a tad lacking or simple which I interpreted as a lack of reward
                                        in playing the game and personally took as a challenge as to how to make Enyo's Escape more challenging. Other concerns 
                                        included a few glitches that needed to be addressed such as bottomless pits as well as some clunky movement the game had.

                                        Although most of the players expressed contentment with the state of the game, some expressed a lack of engagement or 
                                        a lack of reward for performing exceptional (examples of these types of comments are in 'Notable Concerns' above). This lead to the implementation of 
                                        a ranking system for Enyo's Escape for replayability and reward factor.

                                        As part of the reward factor spoken briefly of above, a secret character mode was made unlockable upon completing the 
                                        final level in the game which was designed to be the most difficult.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>

                                    <p>
                                        Taking the reward factor a step further, once the secret mode is unlocked, it can be used to enter a special level that is 
                                        hidden in the game which requires the heavy use of this secret mode. All other modes are not strong enough for this level.

                                        Initially, setting the goal on entering and becoming a finalist at the 2024 Stony Brook Game Programming Competition 
                                        was made to gain experience on working in a team with a language not familiar to us while also creating a fun game. 
                                        Early on however, I understood how personal this project would become to me when elements I proposed were voted in and 
                                        when it became evident that my hobbies with the arts could be potential assests for Enyo's Escape.

                                        Upon actualization of the goal on becoming a Finalist the last available member available to represent Enyo's Escape
                                        for the competition was myself which was incidentally finals week and the week I worked on the

                                        experiences gained however proved invaluable in helping our understanding with typescript, game design, 2d-pixel art, 
                                        sound design, deploying on firebase and of course, teamwork.
