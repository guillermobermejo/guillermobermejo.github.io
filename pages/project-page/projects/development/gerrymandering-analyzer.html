                                        The main purpose of this application is to test for the 'fairness' of a State's previously proposed or enacted political plan.
                                        This decision comes after interpreting the data gathered from conducting various testing measures on the districting proposed 
                                        from the plan in question and how it affects the State.

                                    <p>
                                        Essentially, given a plan and the data from the districting proposed by the plan, how 'fair' is the plan according to 
                                        the calculations made from conducting specific testing measures on this plan as well as in comparison to an 'average' 
                                        plan generated through the averaging of 10,000 plan variations generated on Stony Brook's supercomputer, the 
                                        <span class="font-sbu-red">SeaWulf</span> cluster. This 'average' plan is what serves as the basis for what is considered a 
                                        'fair' plan in our project.

                                        Gerrymandering is known today in U.S. politics as the practice of drawing the boudaries of districts in such a way that it 
                                        benefits the political party whom has drawn them in an election. Of course, this provides an unfair advantage to the proponents
                                        of the drawing while putting the opposing party at an extreme disadvantage.

                                        President of the United States, Elbridge Gerry who famously signed a bill in 1812 that created a partisan district in 
                                        the Boston area that was visually compared to being closely similar to that of a mythological salamander in shape. 
                                        This redistricting was to the benefit of the Democratic-Republican party at the time.

                                        Take the above example of a general population of 50 with 4 examples of boundaries being drawn to form five distinct districts.
                                        In total there are 50 voters to be distributed into 5 partitions, 30 blue and 20 red. In most cases blue should win by way of 
                                        basic probability if picked at random. Now, in particular pay close attention to the <em>right-most</em> drawing.

                                        When looking at voting in retrospect, it is clear that voting simply put is a form of <em class="font-sbu-red">political speech</em> 
                                        and partisan gerrymanders by nature infringe on that speech by promoting a notion of <em class="font-sbu-red">wasted votes</em>.
                                        As the name suggests, wasted votes is the act of votes for a candidate being wasted as a result from strategic redistricting and 
                                        is a concept used in a test measure known as <em>Efficiency Gap</em>. It is a test measure that is used to evaluate 
                                        the potential presence of partisan gerrymanders contained within a plan (more on Efficiency Gap is covered in the

                                        A vote is considered 'wasted' in two scenarios, when a vote is cast for a winner after recieving the necessary amount of votes 
                                        rendering the rest of the votes useless and when the opposite party wins, all votes cast for the losing party are wasted on 
                                        and are equally useless. I choose to say 'useless' for the reason that these votes fail to make a meaningful impact for the
                                        party to whom the vote was cast for, they have been <em>wasted</em>.

                                        the problem). In order for a color to win, 3 of the 5 districts must be won. A district wins by majority vote and in this 
                                        example 6 out of 10 would be needed. Wasted votes are marked with X's.

                                        needed to win within a district the 4 blue votes are 'wasted' and essentially become useless.

                                        blue voter representation. After the district reaches 6 votes for blue, this packing renders the remaining 30% or 3 votes 
                                        'wasted' with the 1 red vote being 'wasted' as well. Notably the loss for blue is greater than that of red in this case and 
                                        these blue votes could have been used more effectively if the districting were more <em>compact</em>.

                                        In the case of <strong>column 4</strong> in this example, wasted votes would indeed matter and should be taken into 
                                        consideration when evaluating 'fairness'. The measure in place to evaluate wasted votes and how it potentially benefits a party
                                        is known as the '<span class="font-sbu-red">Efficiency Gap'</span>. A value indicating a high amount of wasted votes however 
                                        does not necessarily mean gerrymandering has taken place as in the case of columns 2 and 3 but would indicate that something 
                                        is abnormal and the plan should further be analyzed. For this reason a number of different testing measuers are used in this 
                                        application as seen on the next section.

                                        This is how a party can win an election while not having the higher amount of total voters through the <strong>dilution</strong> 
                                        of the opposing parties voting power through districting. Today, districting is done by the political party in office with 
                                        emerging concerns on the opposing side as to how 'fair' a plan proposal really is.

                                        Gerrymandering impacts the people's political voice by diminishing it. In the case that gerrymandering has been 
                                        performed by a plan districting, the following election will follow a nearly <span class="font-sbu-red">pre-determined</span> 
                                        outcome. Such behavior renders the opposing party's voice moot and <strong>infringes</strong> on their policial speech 
                                        through this strategic district drawing that optimizes distribution of voters in favor of the proponents of the plan.

                                        As of June 27, 2019 in a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering 
                                        is not subject to federal court review on the basis that they present 'non-justiciable political questions' effectively
                                        deciding not to end partisan gerrymandering. (more on this

                                        Moon Duchin is an American mathematician and Professor at Tuffs University in Medford, Massachusetts. The research Duchin 
                                        specializes in is primarily on geometric topology, geometric group theory, and Teichmüller theory. Moon Duchin has also done 
                                        extensive work on the mathematics of <em>redistricting</em> and <em>gerrymandering</em> as well as founded a research 
                                        group called the 'MGGG Redistricting Lab' where Duchin and her team continue to advance these mathematical studies.

                                        Duchin is also responsible for the creation of a few plans we use for the state of Alabama. The decision to use Duchin's plans 
                                        was made after the team became aware of <a class="quick-link" href="https://mggg.org/"><em>FiveThirtyEight</em></a> having 
                                        an insufficient number of alternate Alabama districting plans available that were needed for this project.

                                        each measure functions with examples I have created, how to interprete measure results and how these measures pertain to our 
                                        project. These meaures are commonly used to determine anomalous behavior that may occur from a plan districting from a series 
                                        of angles. Anomalous result values may be an indication that the plan districting contains bias towards a party and may 
                                        contain partisan gerrymanders.

                                        A district is <em>considered</em> competitive when the number of voters of each party are close enough to 
                                        <span class="font-sbu-red">equal</span> that the candidate of either party could win. Competitive districts 
                                        ensure that election outcomes are not a definitive conclusion however, the practice of partisan gerrymandering 
                                        poses a threat to the number of competitive districts in the United States.

                                        The effects partisan gerrymanders can have on competitive districts can easily be seen today. Currently, there are fewer 
                                        competitive districts than at any point in the last 52 years and can be exemplified by the state of <em>Texas</em> for 
                                        this past 2022 election.

                                        The most recent 'round' of redistricting saw a tremendous change to the number of competitive districts in Texas.
                                        Before this new districting was enacted 12 of the 36 districts had been competitive whereas after the redistricting 
                                        only <em>3</em> of the 38 districts are competitive (two of them just barely). The former result was from a court districting
                                        whereas the latter result is from a political party districting (read more about this at

                                        It is worth noting that almost all of the Republican districts in Texas are not just considered safe but 'ultra-safe'. 
                                        This led to Donald Trump winning by 15 or more percentage points in 2022, a significant insurance against demographic 
                                        change or political shifts that challenged Republicans in Texas last decade. Partisan gerrymanders allowed the candidate 
                                        to focus on other State's in the election when previously more focus was given to Texas when there were 12 competitive 
                                        districts present.

                                        not 'safe' districts. Competitive districts are worth noting when taking into consideration how 'fair' a plan is in our project. 
                                        If a certain plan is seen to have less competitive districts than another, how drastic this change is could be an indication of 
                                        partisan gerrymanders present in that particular plan in an attempt to create more 'safe' districts as was the case in the 
                                        example of Texas given. In rare instances, having more competitive districts may also warrant a plan to be further analyzed in 
                                        the event that a previously 'safe' district of the opposing party is now a competitive district, a change that might have 
                                        resulted from an effort to potentially gain another seat.

                                        It is generally understood and accepted that legislative districts should be '<em class="font-sbu-red">compact</em>' but 
                                        the exact definition of what compactness is has been subjective. For this reason, compactness measures have been created
                                        that are based on comparing geometric features of districts such as perimeters and areas to features of a related base 
                                        geometric objects such as convex hull.

                                        project uses the Polsby-Popper measure (1991) in order to test for compactness level on the

                                        As was already briefly mentioned in the 
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-overview-why-is-gerrymandering-a-threat"><em>Why is Gerrymandering a Threat?</em></a>

                                        section, efficiency gap is a measure used to evaluate possible partisan gerrymanders through the notion of 'wasted votes'
                                        and to what extent a party may benefit from it. Examples of wasted votes is also contained within this subsection.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The key to understanding wasted votes is to understand that some voters will cast their ballots for candidates who will 
                                        lose (votes are '<em class="font-sbu-red">cracked</em>') while other voters may cast their ballots for candidates who 
                                        will already win (votes are '<em class="font-sbu-red">packed</em>') from the strategically distributed demographic placed 
                                        in each district from the redistricting. With this in mind we can <em>simplify</em> what a gerrymander is to simply being 
                                        a district plan that gives a result of one party having more 'wasted votes' than its advesary.

                                        '<span class="font-sbu-red">Seat Margin</span>' in this formula is the share of all seats held by a party (1 seat for each

                                        is similar in this formula, it is the share recieved by a party (votes won by a party over total combined votes) minus 50%. 
                                        A party is said to have an advantage when the efficiency gap value is positive and a disadvantage when negative.

                                        A value of zero indicates that there is no efficiency gap or rather no advantages for either party from 'wasted votes' 
                                        resulting from the redistricting. A value of no more than <em class="font-sbu-red">8%</em> (.08) is the benchmark to what 
                                        would be considered an acceptable efficiency gap granting <strong>no significant</strong> enough benefit to be considered 
                                        unfair to either party. Passing this value of 8% indicates a significant advantage to a party and would lead one to

                                        Consider the example provided. Party A recieved 55% of the statewide vote (550 votes out of 1000 total) and having done so 
                                        recieved 80% of the seats (8 of the 10 seats were won). Then calculating the efficiency gap yields us an efficiency gap value
                                        of 0.2 or 20% which is not compliant with the efficiency gap measure as it exceeds 0.8 or 8% by 12%.

                                    <p>
                                        There are a few ways to lessen this advantage for Party A. Party A could have won 6 seats instead of the 8 won
                                        at 55% of the vote. This yields an efficiency gap value of 0 ((60% - 50%) - 2 * (55% - 50%) = 0%). An alternative would 
                                        be for Party A to recieve 65% of the vote for the 8 seats won by the party to equally yield an efficiency gap value of 0 
                                        ((80% - 50%) - 2 * (65% - 50%) = 0%). But as it stands, Party A won two more seats than it would have if the parties had wasted 
                                        an equal amount of votes.

                                        As settled in <em>Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725</em> (1983), congressional districts are constitutionally required to be
                                        'as nearly equal in population as practicable'. This is to maintain the 'one-person one-vote' rule that ensures one 
                                        person's voting power ought to be roughly equivalent to another person's within the same state, a rule that comes 
                                        from the <em>Equal Protection</em> law.

                                        The Equal Protection law is guaranteed by the <em>5th</em> and <em>14th</em> amendments and require that each person 
                                        be treated equally in their voting power. However, what this notion of 'equality' means relies on a series of Supreme 
                                        Court cases and so for this project we will assess our equal population measure to be the

                                        taking into consideration the total population.

                                        The metric used for evaluating population equality for state legislative districts is that of 'overall range' 
                                        of deviations. For our project however we use 
                                        <em class="font-sbu-red">mean deviation</em> for similar reasons of using the average compactness of <em>all</em> 
                                        districts for our compactness measure. In this way we are able to remain consistant with using mean and average in our
                                        testing measures.

                                        In the given example, with a total population of 500,000 and 5 district the ideal population would be 100,000 per district 
                                        (500,000 population / 5 districts). The % deviation demonstrates how far in percent a district's population is from what 
                                        is ideal. The mean deviation shows the average deviation of all districts from what is ideal. The ideal value for mean 
                                        deviation is 0% which implies all districts containing the ideal district population with values further from 0% being 
                                        further from this behavior.

                                        A majority-minority district is a district who's population is mainly comprised of a racial minority group or multiple 
                                        minority groups. Majority-minority districts may be created to avoid or remedy violations of the 
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#section-gerrymandering-contribution"><em>Voting Rights Act of 1965</em></a> 
                                        which was designed to enforce voting rights as guaranteed by the <em>14th</em> and <em>15th</em> amendments and to prohibit 
                                        racial discrimination in voting. Such violations may come from a purposeful distribution of a minority group throughout 
                                        districts in order to limit the impact minority groups have on the polls or representation in congress.

                                        Decisions to create these districts are absolutely necessary to give racial minorities representation in Congress 
                                        and have been made throughout US history in situations where it would be near impossible for this to take place naturally.                                    
                                        Majority-minority districts can however be an indication of <em class="font-sbu-red">packing</em> minority groups into

                                        During the 117th Congress (January 3, 2021 - January 3, 2023) out of its 465 congressional districts, the United States 
                                        was home to 65 that were 'majority-minority' districts (15%). The distribution of these districts are shown by the 
                                        provided example but will focus mainly on the Black minority.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        14 of the 50 states had at least one majority black district and about 6 states had more than one.
                                        Statistically, these majority-Black districts amounts to about 22% of the country's total Black population, summing up 
                                        to about 8.9 million African Americans (statistics courtesy of

                                        If a state's districting plan were to contain a new majority-minority district (or more than another of the state's plans)
                                        this could be an indication of possible gerrymandering taking place, especially so if it were in a state that did not previously
                                        have a majority-minority district or in a state that already had more than one.

                                        In this event, the ratio of the minority in the district should be investigated and if it were to be questionably high (above 
                                        60%), should lead one to speculate of possible partisan gerrymanders contained within the plan and should be further

                                        Split county score is the measure used to understand to what degree the districts formed from a given plan districting split 
                                        the state's counties. Specifically we want to understand how much a state's counties are split across multiple districts. 
                                        In this measure, smaller is always better and the ideal scenario would be no splitting.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The most common reason for a county to be split is when a county has more population than a district needs and so that 
                                        county is split between different districts to abide by the congressional rule of district equal population that states 
                                        must abide by. In some cases however, counties are split when the splits themselves are not neccessary.

                                        partitions cut each other into pieces. However in her modification she uses square roots instead of logs to "penalize small

                                        I provided a sample districting for the state of Arizona with each district represented as a different colored region. An 
                                        overlaying of all of Arizona's counties is also included along with county population analytics both within the borders and 
                                        as a comprehesive table based on the 2010 census as an example. With a total population of 6,392,017 and a total of 9 
                                        districts, the ideal population per district for Arizona would be 710,224.11 however, highlighted in red are the counties 
                                        of Maricopa and Pima that each held a population of 3,817,117 and 980,263 respectively. Both of these populations exceed the 
                                        ideal population value, especially from that of Maricopa that has over <em>five times</em> of the ideal population.

                                    <p>
                                        This is why the county of Pima and Maricopa are split far beyond the other counties whose population are so small they are
                                        contained fully within a district such as in sample district 1 and the counties of Coconino, Navajo, Apache, Greenlee, Graham, 
                                        half of Gila and most of Pinal inside it. This accumulation of counties create a district with a population of 710,174.

                                        The ideal value for split county is that of '1' indicating no splits. The greater the score the higher the cuts made to 
                                        the state's counties from districts. Scores generally range from [1-2] however in our project we normalize these scores 
                                        into the range [100-200] for a better readable number making the ideal value 100 but the principle is still the same,
                                        smaller numbers are still better.

                                        A box and whisker plot (commonly called a boxplot) is used in our project for analyzing each plan's district demographic 
                                        data in comparison to the demographic data from the 10,000 plan variations generated on the 
                                        <em class="font-sbu-red">SeaWulf</em> cluster. This boxplot and user options are offered and analyzed in the 
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-gui-tab-6">sixth tab</a> of the application.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The crucial properties of the box and whisker plot are that each individual boxplot shows the distribution of a specific 
                                        set of data. In this case, these sets of data are the state's 10,000 alternate plan district demographic data that the 
                                        user chooses to inspect. Because of this, the plot is extrememly useful for analyzing how each plan's demographical values 
                                        <em>compares</em> to what would be expected from the data of 10,000 <em class="font-sbu-red">unbiased</em> districtings.

                                        I have created the following example to explain the general structure of a box-whisker analysis as it pertains to a boxplot
                                        and our project. Notice that there are 5 main areas that pertain to a box-whisker instance. The minimum, 1st quartile, 
                                        2nd quartile, 3rd quartile and maximum. The box-whisker instance and black points represents a <em>dataset</em> while the 
                                        singular red point represents a <em>test point</em>. 
                                    </p>

                                    <!-- Population Box-Whisker Analysis: Box-Whisker Structure Details -->

                                    <p>
                                        The tail ends of a box-whisker instance represent the minimum and maximum or rather lowest and highest values in the dataset
                                        that the box represents. The 1st quartile, 2nd quartile and 3rd quartile or more commonly referred to as Q1, Q2 and Q3 in 
                                        analysis, constructs the box structure in the box-whisker instance and is also the area of most significance for analysis 
                                        purposes. The box is essentially the middle 50% of the dataset and is typically the desired area for a test point to be in. 
                                        This is for reasons of not having a test value that is too extreme (near the minimum or maximum but not outside the ends) but 
                                        being within a 25% deviation <em>within</em> the median.

                                    <p>
                                        Q1 is 25% of the dataset or the beginning of the middle 50% (the box structure) with Q3 being the opposite. It is 75% of the 
                                        dataset or the end of the middle 50%. Q2 in specific is the <em>median</em> of the dataset or exactly the 50% of the dataset.

                                        There are possibilities for 'outliers' in a boxplot that are values too abnormal to be considered and are usually removed
                                        from the plot, this project is no different. The removal is largely made from the unlikely chance for this value to be a 
                                        possibility of occurence.

                                        An outlier is identified as any value that lies to the left of the lower range limit or to the right of the upper range 
                                        limit. These limits can be found after considering the IQR (interquartile range) which is the value of the third quartile 
                                        minus the value of the first quartile (Q3 - Q1). The formulas are as follows:

                                        We can think of the red point in the example as the value obtained from performing some arbitrary test and the box-whisker 
                                        instance as the dataset from results recorded from 10,000 of these tests. In this example, the value obtained from this 
                                        singular test is approximately 28 which is just below the median. Thus the test result lied near 50% of the dataset recorded 
                                        from the results of 10,000 which is 30 in this case and is within a 3% deviation of the median.

                                        Note if the test result lied significantly far from the box-whisker instance, that is any value less than -30 or greater than 
                                        90, the value would be considered <em class="font-sbu-red">dangerously anomalous</em>. If the value lied past the minimum or 
                                        maximum but is not an outlier, then the value would still be <em class="font-sbu-red">anomalous</em> but not as significant as

                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-gui-tab-3">Plans Summaries</a> tab of the application, however the 
                                        population box-whisker analysis is isolated on its own tab to allow for a better viewing and analyzing experience and is 
                                        contained in the <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-gui-tab-6">Box Whisker</a> tab. This form of analysis 
                                        is <em>especially important</em> as the plan's district demographic population values can be directly compared to the data 
                                        set of the 10,000 unbiased plan variations generated on the <em class="font-sbu-red">SeaWulf</em> cluster.

                                        Each boxplot generated is determined by the users state chosen as well as the user's demographic desired for analysis. These 
                                        decisions are needed to retrieve the data for generating the boxes from the server while the users plans chosen are needed to 
                                        generate the data points to compare to the SeaWulf boxes. The user can choose multiple plans to inspect but not multiple 
                                        demographics. The user will always be able to generate another plot when they are finished reviewing the current one.

                                    <p>
                                        If any of the plan's district demographic data lies outside the box-whisker plots, the behavior should be considered anomalous 
                                        and lead one to speculate of potential partisan gerrymanders contained within the plan and the plan should then be further  
                                        investigated. Additionally, points that lie outside 25% deviation of the median (or simply outside the box) may warrant 
                                        further analysis.

                                            A vote-seat chart (also referred to as a seats-vote share plot or seat-vote curve) is a computer generated graph made from 
                                            plotting the seat share or seat portion a party wins from a certain vote share. In specific, we are interested in analyzing 
                                            the shape the vote-seat chart takes as this shape provides information on the partisan characteristics of a state. In our 
                                            case, this takes the form of how an election outcome can be effected by changes in voting and especially whether or not the 
                                            elections are fair to both parties.

                                        <p>
                                            The three characteristics that we analyze for the vote-seat chart is that of <em class="font-sbu-red">patisan bias</em>,
                                            <em class="font-sbu-red">partisan symmetry</em>, and <em class="font-sbu-red">responsiveness</em>. Analyzing each of these
                                            curve characteristics aids us in determining whether partisan gerrymanders are contained within the plan in question while 
                                            also assisting in furthering our understanding of the power gerrymandering can have in an election as a result by 
                                            investigating the curve behavior and highlighting any biases a party may or may not have and how severe they may be. 
                                            This is the power of plotting election results given from election simulations given a specific plan districting.

                                            Bias is the simplest of the three characteristics. It is the difference between a party's seat share at 50% of the vote and 
                                            the value 50% (note that bias is only tested at 50%). For example, let us say a party won 70% of the seats at 50% of 
                                            the vote, then the partisan bias would be 20% for that party (70% - 50%). Positive bias indicates an advantage to the party 
                                            while negative bias indicates the opposite. Using bias we can determine how much a districting plan favors a particular 
                                            party with the value of 0% being the least biased.

                                            The following example provides a visualization of how bias would look in a Vote-Seat curve. The upper right curve demonstrates
                                            how an ideal seat-vote curve may look like with the resulting bias values being 0% (50% - 50%). The lower left demonstrates 
                                            a seats-vote curve with significant partisan bias of 35% and -35%.

                                            Interpreting bias levels is also straightfoward. The party with the positive value is the party that benefits from the vote to 
                                            seat ratio such as the red party in the example provided. The other party should then have a negative bias value indicating  
                                            the reverse effect or rather a bias against the party, such as the blue party in the example.

                                        <p>
                                            The ideal value for bias is that of 0% indicating no bias towards either party. Inference of possible partisan gerrymanders 
                                            contained within a plan districting is dependent on how close the bias level is to the worst possible level of 50%. Note however
                                            that achieving such a number would be near impossible in practice as that would imply that at 50% of the vote share a party wins 
                                            0% of the seat share while the opposing party wins 100% of the seat share at the same vote share. For this reason, bias levels 
                                            of 10% - 25% is reason enough to further analyze the plan's districting for possible gerrymandering.

                                            Symmetry is a more complicated characteristic of the vote-seat curve although still rather simple. It is the average distance 
                                            between both parties from the range of 45% - 55% of the vote share. With symmetry we can gauge how 'fair' a plan districting
                                            is from it's mirror-like behavior. To elaborate, we must first understand that a desired behavior from a 'fair' districting 
                                            plan is that both parties should recieve the same percentage of seats at the same vote share. Simply put, a plan is considered 
                                            'fair' if a party gains 60% of the seat share at 40% of the vote but only if the reverse is true (opposing party also can get 
                                            60% of the seat share at 40% of the vote). Symmetry tests this exact behavior with the ideal value being that of 0% and the 
                                            worst score being 50%.

                                            The following example provides a visualization of how symmetry would look in a Vote-Seat curve. The upper right curve 
                                            demonstrates how an ideal seat-vote curve may look like with the resulting symmetry value being 0% (average distance between
                                            both parties is 0% between 45% - 55% vote share). The lower left vote-seat curve demonstrates a curve with significant bias
                                            at 20%.

                                            Interpreting the symmerty level is also more complicated but can be summed up in a rather simple way. Using the symmetry level 
                                            of 20% from the lower left vote-seat curve in the example, we can establish that there is a party that is favored at all levels 
                                            from the most critical range of the vote share at 45% - 55% by an <em class="font-sbu-red">average of 20%</em>. The red party 
                                            recieves this benefit in our example while blue is at a disadvantage.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The ideal value for symmetry is that of 0% indicating no bias towards either party. What this means is that neither party 
                                            recieves a significant advantage at all levels over the critical vote share range of 45% to 55%. This would indeed indicate 
                                            a 'fair' plan districting as both parties are able to recieve the exact same seat share at the same vote share. Possible 
                                            partisan gerrymanders contained within a plan districting may be inferred from how far the symmerty level is from this ideal 
                                            value of 0% or how close it is to 50%, a number which would be near impossible to attain in practice. For this reason, symmetry 
                                            levels of 10% - 30% is reason enough to further analyze the plan's districting for possible gerrymandering.

                                            Responsiveness is the most complicated of the vote-seat curve characteristics. It is the average slope of the vote-seat curve
                                            usually from the range of 45% - 55% as the case with symmetry. Unlike the previous two characteristics of the vote-seat curve 
                                            there is no ideal value for this measure. Instead the responsiveness value is used to study the behavior of how both parties' 
                                            votes translate to seats in a state.

                                            It is important to understand that with responsiveness, one particular party is <em>not</em> favored rather, both parties share
                                            the same behavior.

                                            The following example provides a visualization of how a responsiveness value would translate to a vote-seat curve. Each of 
                                            the vote-seat curves in the example display different kinds of behavior the vote-seat ratio may take in an election. 
                                        </p>

                                            The <em class="font-sbu-red">upper left curve</em> with the responsiveness level of about 1% displays how the vote-seat curve 
                                            would look like in a '<em class="font-sbu-red">proportional plan</em>'. Essentially the amount of seat share a party recieves 
                                            with this behavior is dependent on the vote share won, it is essentially as close to 1-1 as possible in this case. This is 
                                            typically the behavior that most individuals think a vote-seat ratio would take with no prior knowledge. The other type of 
                                            behavior an individual might think the curve might take is that of the 'winner take all' scenario.

                                            The <em class="font-sbu-red">lower left curve</em> with the responsiveness level greater than 1% (but lower than 2%) displays 
                                            how the vote-seat curve would look like in a '<em class="font-sbu-red">winner take all</em>' scenario. This kind of behavior 
                                            is brutal for both parties as even around 40% of the vote share, the seats won is only about 20% and at 60% of the vote 
                                            share, about 80% of the seats are won. The most important range for both parties to remain somewhat equal is from that of 
                                            48% - 52% of the vote share which nets 40% - 60% of the seat share in this example. This is in stark contrast with the 
                                            previous curve of the 'proportional plan' where the range was a more generous 40% - 60% of the vote share which nets 
                                            40% - 60% of the seat share respectively.

                                            curve would look like in the event that the plan districting is highly compliant with the 
                                            <em class="font-sbu-red">efficiency gap</em>, a measure used for evaluating possible partisan gerrymanders which I discussed

                                            This curve follows the efficiency gap slope of .8 or 8% which is an area where a vote to seat outcome would be considered 
                                            having a 'fair' wasted vote value of under 8%. I took the liberty of implemented this shaded area in our vote-seat chart to

                                            curve indicates protection from losing a significant amount of seats in the event of a party losing the popular vote by 
                                            securing a respectable amount of the seat share starting at a significantly low vote share. This is evident in the example 
                                            from around the 20% vote share mark with 20% of the vote share winning about 40% of the seats and from the vote share range 
                                            of 60% - 80% displaying low gains in seat share but securing <em>at least</em> half of the seats.

                                            Notably, the responsiveness levels that we should look out for are those under 1% as that would indicate the possibility of 
                                            the plan districting containing partisan gerrymanders. With responsiveness levels under 1% the behavior exhibited from the 
                                            vote to seat translation would be that of a low vote share winning an abnormally high seat share. Another way to put it would 
                                            be that this responsiveness level indicates a behavior from the vote to seat translation in an election that secures a 
                                            respectable seat share from a forgivable range of the vote share in the event of a loss, such as in our example at the 20% 
                                            vote share mark with a party winning 40% of the seat share and with the range 20% - 50% of the vote share winning 
                                            <em>at least</em> 40% of the seat share and onward.

                                            In the event that the responsiveness level is under 1%, this would indicate that an election held under this plan districting 
                                            would produce similar behavior and may likely contain partisan gerrymanders. In this scenario the plan districting should be

                                        In this section I briefly go over the project design and UML diagrams that were created for various parts of our project during 
                                        the design phase. These diagrams cover the class hierarchy used extensively for the Back-End and partly for the Front-End,
                                        the preprocessing stage for data preperation prior to testing measure and plan generation calculations on the SeaWulf cluster,
                                        and a diagram for some of the main processes of the SeaWulf calculations.

                                        Our diagram software of choice was Lucidchart. Using LucidChart our team created UML diagrams for the main 3 components of our
                                        project previously mentioned.

                                        The <em>GeographicalFeature</em> class is the basis for all classes required to be represented on the map using GeoJSON. 
                                        In our project these cases would be for a State's counties, precincts, districts, districting plan and the State's 
                                        borders themselves. The GeoJSON's of a state's borders, counties and precincts are obtained from the State class's 
                                        public methods getStateBorder(), getCountiesBorder(), and getPrecinctsBorder() respectively while that of a state's 
                                        districts and plan districting is obtained from the Plan class's public method getPlanBorder().
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The GeographicalFeature class also has an attribute called <em>demography</em>, a map that uses 
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-uml-class-diagram-demographicgroup-class"><em>DemographicGroup,</em></a> an enumeration
                                        class as keys and <em>Doubles</em> as values. This simplifies data retrieval requests for a state's plan and 
                                        <em class="font-sbu-red">SeaWulf</em> demographic data on the
                                        server needed for box-whisker analysis. As such, the GeographicalFeature abstract class has an association with the 
                                        <em>DemographicGroup</em> class and the <em>DemographicGroup</em> class has an association with the 
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-uml-class-diagram-boxwhisker-class"><em>BoxWhisker</em></a> class.

                                        and plan are converted to GeoJSON. Relevant information pertaining to these precincts are stored in JSON (i.e., population, 
                                        demography, vote split for precincts), followed by pairing this JSON with GeoJSON. A precinct graph is

                                        This section briefly goes over the overall implementation phase of our project that immediately followed the design phase which 
                                        I spoke about <a class="quick-link" href="#section-gerrymandering-project-design"><em class="font-sbu-red">here</em></a>
                                        including the implementation of the GUI concept.

                                        The general structure of our project implementation was to begin with implementing a shell of the front-end based on an 
                                        initial GUI concept (covered next). What followed was the full on implementation of the use-cases for the front-end with the 
                                        functions that request data on the server set to retrieve local data until the server was ready. Next was the implementation 
                                        of the database & server, connecting them to the front-end and finally implementing the Seawuf Cluster calculations and 
                                        incorporating them in the back-end.

                                    <p>
                                        The main takeaway from this section is our initial GUI concept and 1 main use-case diagram for which most front-end / back-end
                                        interactions follow. The use-case diagram is for obtaining a State's plan data needed for the plan tabs on the front-end
                                        upon the user requesting to view these tabs, specifically the 
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-gui-tab-2"><em class="font-sbu-red">Plan Details</em></a> and

                                        This diagram demonstrates how most of the interactions between the front-end and back-end were implemented and as a result why
                                        most of the use-case diagrams follow this same structure. Lastly, a few extra use-case diagrams will be mentioned.

                                        The image showcased on the right was our initial GUI design concept. This concept did not have the tab design of our final GUI 
                                        with the final GUI also not containing the bottom display for displaying chart data. Instead in order to allow users easier
                                        nativigation with the application, we moved the chart data into their own tabs per testing measure expanded the size of the left 
                                        bar and increased the height of the map to compensate for the width decrease of the map in our changes during implementation.

                                        Most of the interactions were implemented in much the same way as in this use-case diagram that depicts a user choosing a 
                                        state. The workflow goes as follows.

                                        On the front-end, a user chooses a state by either selecting a state on the map 
                                        or through the 'Selected State' button located on the static toolbar of the application. Once clicked, the front-end will 
                                        then execute a function call with the selected state's enum id (more in
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-contribution-gui">application code structure</a>)
                                        and request the server the data necessary to display that 
                                        state's information on the first tab, the

                                        The server then makes a call to the data controller requesting the
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-uml-class-diagram-state-class">State</a> object, finds it by the id given
                                        and returns this object. If not created a new State object is created with the information of that state retrieved 
                                        from the database and stores the newly created object in the data controller. Finally the html session is set to 
                                        the id of the state and the necessary information from State returned from a call from that State object as a JSON
                                        which the front-end parses, displaying said information on the GUI.

                                        by returning the data returned from State object's getBoxWhiskerPlot() function as a JSON. The box plots themselves were

                                        As previously mentioned, the application was implemented in much the same way for most of the use-cases however there were 
                                        a few instances where actions would demand slightly less of more from the application. Two of these scenarios are when 
                                        comparing two plans against each other in the

                                        Reseting the page on the application makes us deviate from requesting the server for information as in the previous 
                                        use-case diagram which most are based on. In this use-case, instead of the front-end requesting data from the server
                                        to be sent its way, the front-end signifies the server that the user wishes to reset the page with the server responding
                                        by setting the session to null. This signifes that the page has been reset and the status of 200 returned if successful.

                                        on the static toolbar at the top of the application. This flys the user back to the initial setting of the application

                                        The use-case operates in a similar manner to the select state use-case diagram with the difference being in the number of 
                                        plan data being requested. Since the front-end is requesting the data for the radar plot, it is already known that a state 
                                        has been selected and what is requested is a

                                        upon request of this data, the server retrieves the current State from the session, retrieves the data from the call to 
                                        the State object's getRadarPlot() method and returns the data as a JSON to the front-end which is then parsed and displayed 
                                        on the radar plot.

                                        The plan that is currently being focused on is the plan that will be used for comparison with the 
                                        default 2020 plan being used as the comparison. If the plan currently being focused on is the 2020 plan, the 2022 plan 
                                        appears on the radar plot alone.

                                        the ability to perform high-performance calculations such as performing district recombinations totaling 10,000 as well as

                                        each recombination through parallel processing. These 10,000 recombinations are then averaged out

                                        As the 'middle man' between the front-end and database, the server responds to data requests from the front-end, returning 
                                        the requested data after retrieving it from the database. Java and SpringBoot are the main technologies used for the server 
                                        with the relational MySQL used for the database.

                                        Just as with the class diagram the server is based on, the server revolves around the 
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-uml-class-diagram-state-class"><em>State</em></a> class. Every request to the server 
                                        has the server respond with some data from the <em>State</em> class pertaining to the state chosen by the user's getter methods.
                                    </p>

                                        Each <em>State</em> object contains objects of the class

                                        It is important to note that what is returned is not the <em>State</em> object itself but objects of the <em>State</em>
                                        class. This is done to avoid sending more information than is needed to the front-end for any particular form of analysis 
                                        wanted to be performed by the user.

                                        The way a <em>State</em> object is initially created server-side is upon the user selecting a state for viewing on the 
                                        front-end. More on this is explained in the following subsection.

                                        This following behavior is mainly implemented in this way to gain experience with the server and with implementing a full-stack

                                        If the state <em>does not</em> currently exist and is not in the <em>StateRepository</em>, then the <em>StateEntityCreator</em>

                                        the server's overhead by eliminating the scenario of repeated data requests to the database by the server for repeated tasks

                                        The GUI was implemented using a <em>2-sided screen</em> approach. The left hand side handles most of the 
                                        user interaction and is the side used for displaying the data based on user criteria with the right side handling the 
                                        map, i.e., scrolling, zooming, on-click functionality. A <em>static tool bar</em> is anchored above the main 
                                        display consisting of a focus label and three drop down menus. The left most handling flying in or out of a state, 
                                        the middle handling the overlaying of plans as well as serving as an indicater of how many plans has been selected, 
                                        the right most handling the overlying of a demographic heat map on the map with the focus label displaying the plan 
                                        currently focused on for analysis.

                                        style to toggle between different analysis tabs, each consisting of their respective graphical representation. Upon launch

                                        The application is structured taking the idea of the <em class="font-sbu-red">MVC</em> software design architecture. The 
                                        idea was to get accustomed to a standard design pattern to encourage code reusability and make debugging easier through 
                                        thought out organization.

                                        Notably, the configuration folder and identifier folder hold the configuration of the map (i.e., max zoom-in/zoom-out, 
                                        max scroll) and other default values while the other holds the <span class="font-sbu-red">Enum</span> classes for identifying 
                                        specific state, plan or box-whisker groups. This is done for isolating debugging and establishing global identifiers 
                                        for the application to refrain from using '<em>magic numbers</em>'.

                                        map for states and plans. This was kept on the Front-End to lessen the strain on the Server for sending big GeoJSON 
                                        files and improving application run time.

                                        The interaction between the GUI and Server is straightforward. When the user interacts with the GUI or rather the 'view', 
                                        the controller makes a request to the server and the server responds, returning the appropriate object based on the

                                        Taking the first showcase of this section of flying to states, when the user chooses a state from the state drop down menu or 
                                        from clicking on a state on the map, the controller sends a request to the server for the

                                        pertaining to the state chosen. The JSON object returned by the Server contains the state's general information used on the

                                        populating the graphs for analysis on subsequent tabs. Some data is <em>cached</em> on the Front-End in order to reduce 
                                        the strain of making multiple calls for costly data and affecting performance as a result.

                                        knowledge of Canva to create a miniature logo for our team. It was created early on during the GUI concept to personalize our work 
                                        with the project concept. The general theme of the project is to 'fly' to different states of concern for analyzing plans of interest 
                                        for possible gerrymandering. For this reason the basis of the logo is a plane cicling the globe while holding our team's banner. 
                                        Canva was also used to create our basic GUI layout concept that was later implemented during our GUI Implementation phase.

                                        The gerrymandering analyzer application is given basic map handling. The user is able to click one of three states at the moment, 
                                        namely Arizona, Arkansas and Alabama. These states may be clicked by either clicking on the 'Selected State' button or physically 
                                        clicking on the map. Clicking on these states flies the user to the state where the most recent plan named '2020' is presented 
                                        on the map by default. The user may then inquire about the state through the many tabs located on the left side of the application 
                                        and is provided general information about the state chosen on the map. Dragging the map in this state is allowed, the currently 
                                        overlayed plans remain with the user able to request refocusing to the current state chosen.

                                        Functionality for selecting multiple plans is handled through the use of a stack data structure to keep track of the 
                                        previous plan selected. This is done to establish the behavior of 'auto-focus' when deselecting plans. An example of 
                                        this is when deselecting the current plan focused on. Doing so will then automatically give focus to the plan selected 
                                        immediately before said plan, if that plan were to have been deselected, the previous one before that one is given focus. 
                                        Deselecting a plan previously chosen <em>before</em> the current focused on plan will not affect the focus.

                                        allows the user to better visualize how concentrated if any minority groups were 'packed' as well as potentially determining

                                        chosen.

                                        can then be inspected against this demographic data. The minority groups of most interest are those that can be readily 
                                        inspected via demographic heatmap i.e., the most populous. These minority groups are hispanic, black and asian minority 
                                        groups. This provides the user more visualization tools along side the raw data provided in the left statistics to provide

                                        After creating the necessary functions to request data from the server in the datacontroller on the front-end, the testing 
                                        of these functions followed. The testing itself was done in an incremental fashion i.e., per use case with no new server function 
                                        call being implemented until the current was successfully completed.

                                        Prior to this connection, local JSON data was placed in a temporary folder on the front-end to act as the data retrieved to 
                                        practice server requests by implementing a local version of the call. The implementation itself for the real server call came after 
                                        a successful attempt to retrieve the local data. Every use case followed this format i.e., getRadarPlot() for the

                                            Also present on this tab is a Vote-Seat chart along with a few metrics for interpreting this chart. The vote-seat chart is 
                                            based on data points calculated on the <em class="font-sbu-red">SeaWulf</em> supercomputer and is based on the districting 
                                            of the current plan as to how voting might turn out. Notably the <strong><em>range</em></strong> for this chart is between 
                                            30% to 70% of votes (represented as the x-axis) as the tail ends do not offer much for analytical purposes as the following 
                                            tests operate on data between 45% - 55% of the total votes. These tests for determining the 'fairness' of this plan in 
                                            relation to the Vote-Seat data are those of <strong><em>responsiveness</em></strong>, <strong><em>bias</em></strong> and 
                                            <strong><em>symmetry</em></strong>.

                                            From this showcase example of Arizona's 2022 plan, we can see that the <strong>responsiveness level</strong> of 
                                            <strong>2.46%</strong> is actually highly compliant with the efficiency gap meaning that potential gerrymandering shenanigans 
                                            being present is low as there are not many instances of wasted votes, of course indicating the plan is 'fair'. Toggling the 
                                            efficiency gap indicators on the chart reveal the shaded region where data is considered compliant with the efficiency gap 
                                            (<em class="font-sbu-red">Moon Duchin</em> establishes this EG slope in a presentation found

                                            Using this fact, it can be visually confirmed that this conclusion of the responsiveness is correct.

                                            The responsiveness level of &#60 1% is the most dangerous as it indicates an incumbent protection gerrymander at place. 
                                            From the example above we can see that at 20% of the vote, a party gains 40% of the seat effectively guarding against 
                                            low votes by ensuring almost 1/2 half of total seats from only 1/5th percentage of total votes. This behavior of course 
                                            would be from a direct result of gerrymandering taking place from the plan's districting. The amount of wasted votes 
                                            resulting from the gerrymandering would be to blame.

                                            <strong><em>Bias:</em></strong>  Bias is the difference between a party's seat share at 50% of the vote and 50% (Notably bias 
                                            is ONLY tested at 50%). Say a party has 70% of the seats at 50% of the vote, then the partisan bias would be 20%. Using bias 
                                            we can determine how much a districting plan favors a particular party of course with 0% being the least biased. Typically, the 
                                            larger of the absolute value of the two responsiveness values indicate which party is favored. A negative value indicates a 
                                            bias towards Democrats while a positive value indicates the opposite.

                                            In our example, both bias levels are close to 0% indicating that the 2022 plan does not have a significant partisan bias towards 
                                            either party. It is worth noting as well that both values are positive for simplifying the analysis. In this way, the larger 
                                            of the two values for Republican and Democratic responsiveness is the party that has a greater bias towards them. Since they 
                                            are equivalent in our case and near 0% we conclude that there is no significant bias towards either party.

                                            range of 45% to 55% of the vote share. The behavior desired from a 'fair' districting plan for seat share is that both parties 
                                            should recieve the same percentage of seats at the same vote share. Essentially in a 'fair' plan, Republicans can get 60% of 
                                            the seats at 40% of the votes only if the reverse is true and Democrats get 60% of the seats at 40% of the votes. The ideal 
                                            value is 0% with the worst score being 50%.

                                            Analyzing the radar plot is straightforward. Based on the testing measures below, you compare the test measure value to 
                                            that of another plan on the radar plot to determine which is more anomolous if at all. Explanations of these values were

                                            A value is considered to be anomalous if a plan's metric value is more 'extreme'. That is to say the plan's value 
                                            is greater or less than 95% of the plan variations generated.

                                        <p>
                                            Notably, it is important to recognize the difference between something being anomalous and being <strong>not</strong> 
                                            'fair'. If one or more of these metrics are flagged as being anomalous, it is more so that the metric may indicate 
                                            that a particular plan may contain elements that leads to it being considered not 'fair' and should be further inspected.

                                            In our example of Arizona's 2022 Plan, 4 metrics were found to be anomalous. Those of Democratic and Republican 
                                            responsiveness, Democratic Bias and Symmetry. Further inspection of the responsiveness level found in the 
                                            <span class="font-sbu-red">Plan Details</span> of <strong>2.46%</strong> demonstrates a vote-seat curve highly compliant 
                                            with the EG. In this case what is anomalous is that the plan may be 'too' fair or rather more fair than 95% of the 
                                            alternate plans generated. The same goes for the other values.

                                            The groups minority groups chosen for these tests were that of the Hispanic and Black minority. This decision was 
                                            made from the sheer lack of size of other minority groups to be the majority of a district i.e., Native American,

                                            district being formed. This is understandable considering there are <strong>currently</strong> no instances of a

                                            Counties are generally split when the population is too high and also in accordance to keep within the metric of

                                            A 'split county score' of <strong>1%</strong> is ideal as this means 
                                            that counties have not been split, the larger the number more splitting has been involved. In our case regarding the 
                                            state of Arizona, all plan's split county score are still considered good being between <strong>1.27% - 1.37%</strong>.

                                            plans 7,592 of them have 13-14 instances of county splitting. This amount of spliting makes sense when taking a look 
                                            at Arizona's county data, specifically Maricopa and Pima, the rank 1 and 2 counties being significantly larger than the others.

                                            chosen is compared to the average demographic population per district based off of the averaging of those 10,000 alternate

                                            This can be done by simply comparing both distances and determining which plan's demographic fall closer to the median.

                                        As previously stated, this gerrymandering analyzer application finished in <em class="font-sbu-red">first place</em> among 
                                        7 teams in the GUI phase, project design phase, implementation phase and the final presentation and showcase phase. The 
                                        overall roles of front-end, server, database and seawulf were distributed among 4 members, which I took on the role of the 
                                        front-end developer.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This was a unique position where I had the opportunity to learn a substantial amount and gain experience on but not limited to
                                        HTML, JavaScript, CSS, full-stack development, project design with UML, teamwork, planning and coordination with implementation.

                                        The application was written using mainly <em class="font-sbu-red">HTML</em>, <em class="font-sbu-red">JavaScript</em>, 
                                        <em class="font-sbu-red">CSS</em> and minor <em class="font-sbu-red">Bootstrap</em>. This project helped in understanding and 
                                        creating static websites and web applications with the frameworks and graphing libraries used namely 
                                        <em class="font-sbu-red">Frappe Charts</em>, <em class="font-sbu-red">Chart.js</em>
                                        and <em class="font-sbu-red">Plotly</em> helping in understanding parsing and visualizing JSON graph data. Additionaly, 
                                        as <em class="font-sbu-red">LucidChart</em> was used for the majority of our planning, I gained experience with use-case, 
                                        sequence and activity diagrams creation and planning. 
                                    </p>

                                        Although the Seawulf code was written in <em class="font-sbu-red">Python</em>, my experience as a research assistant at 
                                        Stony Brook University within the field of Gerrymandering analysis at <em class="font-sbu-red">Politech</em>, I have also 
                                        gained a greater understanding of ensemble generation and visualization.
