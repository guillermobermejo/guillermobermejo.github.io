                                        Angelina's Deli contacted me with an inquiry on June 2022 about a quota for designing and implementing dynamic menu systems 
                                        to replace their current static wall menu system. A 'test sample' menu was requested, using a concept image the owner liked on 
                                        youtube for their newly installed juice bar. I inquired if the deli would like custom images of their food items or if stock 
                                        images would suffice in order to prepare my camera gear. The feedback was stock images.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        My goal then was to take that image along with their entire juice bar menu and give it life. The showcased image above is the 
                                        client sample sent to me. Below it is the gif image I responded with.

                                        The main goal of the recreation was to capture the feel of their juice bar based on their menu. The menu largely consisted of 
                                        organic choices and so the color pallet I choose was a color closer to orange than was sent, off-white, and a transparent teal.

                                    <p>
                                        A bubble background was incorporated to highlight the use of berries prevalent in many of their menu items as well as the tapioca 
                                        used for the bubble tea menu item. I also included a sample of 'highlighted menu item' boards to transition between the menu and 
                                        these highlighted items based on the deli's most popular items. Orange was used as a background bubble behind prices to make them
                                        better pop as opposed to the dullness of the image sent.

                                        After the initial test sample, Angelina's Deli requested a quota for a 5 story board menu package in hopes of transitioning from 
                                        their static menu board wall system. Once negotiations were settled, I was tasked with designing and implementing 3 original 
                                        story board menus for breakfast, lunch and mexican food. Additionally there was a 'required' story board that needed to be designed 
                                        and implemented.

                                        As the deli is sponsored by <a class="quick-link" href="https://boarshead.com/">Boar's Head,</a> they were required to have a 
                                        story board dedicated soley to Boar's head. This came with a unique opportunity to use a 
                                        <a class="quick-link" href="https://boarshead.com/nutrition/gourmet-charcuterie">concept image</a> on the official Boar's head 
                                        website to act as a template for the menu. This image was designed originally as a 'Craft A Gourmet Charcuterie Board' and is 
                                        showcased to the right, and with this I gave the final statement of work to Angelina's Deli.

                                        choose not to demonstrate each for the sake of avoiding reduncancy. Instead I go over the overall structure of each as they
                                        all follow a similar pattern per board.

                                        The general structure of the boards is to transition between a 'Story Board Menu' to a 'Highlight Item'. These highlighted
                                        items are their own 30 second transition. The positioning of these boards goes in the order that they are listed above.
                                        The partitioning of animation positions are the following:

                                        The initial menu did not specify direct seperation of the food items and so for each board, a subset of items are 
                                        contained within their own block of course all falling under the same overall category.

                                        The central theme of this board was to portray an 'ease' to getting morning breakfast. As breakfast items are offered 
                                        all day at the establishment, consideration for this was also taken and so the neutral color of a light lime was chosen.
                                        Each food item is carefully broken up into multiple transparent green block sections. These sections are of 'Omelettes', 
                                        'Sandchiches', 'Pancakes', 'Waffles', 'French Toast', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Oatmeal', 'Salads' and 'Breads Available'.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With the foresight of potentially pairing the designs of 2 boards to avoid the clashing of multiple designs, this palette 
                                        was also considered for the lunch board design. Pairing these 2 boards was the most intuitive, being closer related in 
                                        the context of food establishments than say 'Breakfast' and 'Mexican Food' or 'Juice Bar'. Their positioning was also 
                                        considered.

                                        Paired with the Breakfast board, the central theme of this board is also to portray an 'ease' to getting lunch on a work break. 
                                        This board is broken up into 2 story boards as the establishment has an incredible amount of choices. These 2 sections are of
                                        'General Lunch' and 'Angelina's Specialty Sandwiches'.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The 'General Lunch' board contians the subsets of 'Burgers', 'Flounder', 'Sandwhiches', 'Soups', 'Wings' and 'Breads Available'.
                                        The 'Angelina's Specialty Sandwhiches' board contians a single subset but for ease of use, the 'Breads Available' subset is also 
                                        included for the common case of a customer desiring a different type of bread.

                                        The 'Angelina's Specialty Sandwhiches' two subsets are seperated by a sideways 'Hero' image. The end result is extremely 
                                        appealing to the eyes. The same concept of block color palette matching was used with the darker shaded green blocks used 
                                        to draw attention to the left-hand sides containing the information of the item. Just as with the Breakfast board, the 
                                        underlinings are also animated.

                                        For the highlighted food items in this board, no blocks were used. Instead a focus on the overall colors and font color was 
                                        emphasized. In addition to the animated underlining for drawing attention to the prices, as Mexican Food is often a collection 
                                        of muliple components such as with rice bowls, an animated circling of customizable options was implemented.

                                    <p>
                                        As previously mentioned in the <a class="quick-link" href="#subsection-overview-project-description">Project Desciption</a> 
                                        subsection, the design inspiration of this board is from an official static Boar's Head image for 'Characuterie Boards'. 
                                        As the board was to only contain the items in the establishment that are from Boar's Head, this design was extremely beneficial
                                        towards this limit. The 'transitions' are between two types of Characuterie Boards, taking advantage of the natural visual 
                                        appeal of the combination of these items.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The establishment only offers meats and cheeses from Boar's head with the variety being impressingly wide. Because of this, 
                                        both sides of the board highlight and list these two sets with the listing and price styles modified to fit within the constraints
                                        of both sides.

                                    <p>
                                        Instead of having both sides be transparent as in the image design, a solid color was chosen to accomadate the animations that
                                        take place within them. This is especially true for the image transitions.

                                        The initial design of this board came from a screenshot of a tutorial video of how to create a story board the owner of the 
                                        establishment found. The owner sent me this image and desired for a 'sample' of what I could produce for him. The goal for this 
                                        board was to then to expand on this design and go from a static image to a live story board.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The changing of the color palette was done for 2 reasons. To bring more life to the board and to emphasize on the 'heathy option'
                                        food item theme. The palettes used were bright colors as close as possible to the color of oranges without being hard on the eyes.
                                        A 'bubble' white and grey background was used to accentuate the use of bubble like items in each item such as tapiaco for bubble 
                                        teas and berries for smoothie drinks or salads. The use of trasparent cyon blocks were used to seperate subsets in this board.

                                    <p>
                                        The food subsets for this board include 'Bubble Tea', 'Milk Shakes', 'Smootheis', 'Acai Bowls', 'Yogurt Parfait' and 'Veggie Shots'.

                                        The design of this QR Code flier was taken from the already implemented 'Mexican Food' board. This was a choice done so from
                                        the owner of the establishment pride in his ethnicity and what he has to offer. The scanning of this code takes you to the 
                                        static menus of all boards without the 'highlight item' concept. This was done so in an effort to minimize customer displeasure 
                                        at having to wait an interval to read their desired menu again. Additionaly, it was done so to help in advertising the food options 
                                        the establishment offers as there was no such system in place before.
